  <h2 id="storyline">Storyline</h2>
  <p>
    If you're interested why my tagline is <span class="bold-italics">nerd on a mission</span>, here's my story:
  </p>
  <section class="story">
<p>
    &Tab;I had somewhat of a rough start at life. School wasn't working out for me, family and financial problems were certainly a thing, and I dropped out of high school very early on. Yet at 17 an epiphany happened... I'd wasted 17 years accepting defeat, and I needed to flip that around and live a life of service. Courage had dethroned my apathy, and that day I began a pretty fun and challenging journey.
</p>
<p>
    &Tab;It started with books, and lots of them. Philosophy, world religion, psychology, sociology, history and so on. I hurriedly got my GED, enrolled full time in community college, had academic counselors waive my heavy course loads, and transferred to university after a year.
</p>
<p>
    &Tab;Some of what's happened since: volunteered at and eventually directed a nonprofit supporting refugees in Portland; got my degree in Social Science, focusing on global challenges such as population, poverty, climate, conflict, resources, disease, etc.; advocated for peace in the mideast, travelled alone through the region twice, learned Turkish and taught English in Turkey; interned with UN - HABITAT in Vietnam, worked on a couple US Embassy funded projects, founded an “entrepreneurship for sustainability” program, and cofounded a hacker and maker space.
</p>
<p>
    &Tab;I'm more than mildly obsessed with global challenges, community building, the antidote and poison of emerging technologies, effectiveness of humanitarian efforts, and the interplay between science & society.
</p>
<p>
    &Tab;I'm 24 now, moving into a more focused season of life, and my next set of ambitions will require patient practice. Part of that process is learning how to play with computers. Thus, the last 5 months I've been taking accelerated programs (in-person bootcamp and online) in software dev and data analysis. These will be invaluable skills, and the time taken off from work to learn the basics - and the empty wallet that's followed - has been well worth it.
</p>
<p>
    &#x00009;My long term vision is twofold: to play an ambassador-like role between science & society as we move forward into complex times; and leverage 21st century tools to tackle serious challenges, whether in an organization I join or one I found.

<p>
    &#9;The next 2 years I'll focus on my technical skills, establishing a larger network, and paying the bills (hire me?), preferably alongside an ambitious and altruistic team.

          <div class="panel-body">I was always a dreamer. As a child, I dreamt about exploring jurassic jungles, traveling through the cosmos, being a National Geographic photographer, opening hosptials for those in need... It never ended.

          <br><br>However, as I got older that dreaming was coupled with fear. I was stamped with ADD and believed medicine was the only way to function. I dropped out of high school halfway through, shielded myself from family trauma, and resigned myself to working retail forever. Only until one random December day at the age of 17 I had an awakening. I wasted 17 years of the one life I had, and I was going to squeeze the pulp out of the rest of it.

          I had somewhat of a rough start at life. School wasn't working out for me, family and financial problems were certainly a thing, and I dropped out of high school very early on. Yet at 17 an epiphany happened... I'd wasted 17 years accepting defeat, and I needed to flip that around and live a life of service.

            It started with books, and lots of them. Philosophy, eastern spirituality, poetry, psychology, sociology, and so on. I was enthralled, and seeing friends on the weekend no longer mattered. Courage had dethroned my fear, and the dreams felt possible. I hurriedly got my GED, enrolled full time in community college and had counselors waive my heavy course loads. I transferred to university after a year.

            <br><br>There, I got involved in student leadership groups, local nonprofits and conversation circles with highly caffeinated idealists. I was promoted director of a nonprofit supporting Portland refugees, had studied in Turkey for 6 months, witnessed the Israeli/Palestinian conflict firsthand, fled to Beirut from Egypt because of violent protests, and observed new worlds.

            <br><br>I finished with a degree in Social Science. It was self designed, and focused on challenges we face as a global society. A booming population, rapid urbanization, a disturbed biosphere, inter-civilizational conflict, resource depletion, income inequality and more. One institution, the United Nations, put a rosy shade over my glasses and I wanted nothing more than to work for them.

            <br><br>It only took two weeks after graduating to move to Vietnam and work with the UN, and on an unrelated State Department project. It wasn't the panacea I thought it was, so after finishing both projects I founded Vietnam's first hacker and maker space, as well as a nonprofit supporting entrepreneurs and SME's with coaching, small investments, workshops, and more. Since my presence and energy was more critical during their formative phases, once they were sustainable I finished my year in Vietnam and flew back home. Then I got thinking again.

            <br><br>It took merely four years to achieve what I thought would take a life time... so I needed bigger dreams.

            I knew what I was capable of. I had an idea of where the world was going, and through that complexity I dialled in on what I wanted to do, and it involves emerging technologies. Why?

            <br><br>The opening sentence of the World Economic Forum's 2016 <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf">Future of Jobs Report</a> answered that pretty well:
            <br><blockquote>"Developments in genetics, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing and biotechnology, to name just a few, are all building on and amplifying one another. This will lay the foundation for a revolution more comprehensive and all-encompassing than anything we have ever seen."</blockquote>

            <br>The convergence of the emerging technologies with society would undoubtedly be a fundamental force of change in the 21st century. Many of these changes would prove to be both anecdotes and poisons. I knew what I needed to do to point the needle in our favor, and I needed to learn software to do it. Only a day later I was enrolled in one of Portland's twelve week software bootcamp, and a week later the camp began. The new, long-term, more calibrated, and focused season of life had begun.
            <br><br>Throughout the 3-month course I also won first place in a Startup Weekend, a trip to SXSW and a few months coworking space downtown. After I finished, the next phase began: pushing code and networking.

            It's been ~1 month since graduating, and I'm scouting Portland for an ambitious company to join as an entry-level engineer and put every ounce of effort in becoming senior level within a few years. I'm prioritizing full stack roles and those that allow me to play with large datasets. I'm looking to find the right home by October.
