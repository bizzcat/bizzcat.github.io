    <h5 class='chapter'>0 to 17: Dreaming coupled with fear</h5>
    I was always a dreamer. As a child, I dreamt about exploring the jungles of the jurassic period, traveling through the cosmos, taking photos of exotic animals for the National Geographic... It never ended.

    <br><br>However, as I got older that dreaming was coupled with fear. I was stamped with ADD and believed medicine was the only way to function. I dropped out of high school halfway through, shielded myself from family trauma, and resigned myself to working retail forever. Only until one random December day at the age of 17 I had an awakening. I wasted 17 years of the one life I had, and I was going to squeeze the pulp out of the rest of it.


    <hr><h5 class='chapter'>18 to 23: Dreaming coupled with courage</h5>
    It started with books, and lots of them. Philosophy, eastern spirituality, poetry, psychology, sociology, and so on. I was enthralled, and seeing friends on the weekend no longer mattered. Courage had dethroned my fear, and the dreams felt possible. I hurriedly got my GED, enrolled full time in community college and convinced my counselors to waive my heavy course loads. I transferred to university after a year.

    <br><br>There, I got involved in everything I could. Student leadership groups, local nonprofits and conversation circles with highly caffeinated idealists. I was promoted director of a nonprofit supporting Portland refugees, studied in Turkey for 6 months, witnessed the Israeli/Palestinian conflict firsthand, fled to Beirut from Egypt because of violent protests, and observed new worlds.

    <br><br>I finished with a degree in Social Science. It was self designed, and focused on challenges we face as a global society. A booming population, rapid urbanization, a disturbed biosphere, inter-civilizational conflict, resource depletion, income inequality and more, as well as the role of global institutions in each. One of those institutions, the United Nations, put a rosy shade over my glasses and I wanted nothing more than to work for them.

    <br><br>It only took two weeks after graduating to move to Vietnam and work with the UN, and on an unrelated State Department project. After finishing both, I founded Vietnam's first hacker and maker space, and a nonprofit supporting entrepreneurs and SME's with coaching, small investments, workshops, and more. Since my presence and energy was more critical during the formative phase of the projects, once they were sustainable I finished my time in Vietnam and flew back home. Then I got thinking again.

    <br><br>It took merely four years to achieve what I thought would take a life time... so I needed bigger dreams.


    <hr><h5 class='chapter'>24: Bigger dreams, stronger courage, better strategy, more persistence.</h5>
    I knew what I was capable of. I had an idea of where the world was going, and through that complexity I dialled in on what I wanted to do, and it involves emerging technologies. Why?

    <br><br>The opening sentence of the World Economic Forum's 2016 <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf">Future of Jobs Report</a> answered that pretty well:
    <br><blockquote>"Developments in genetics, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing and biotechnology, to name just a few, are all building on and amplifying one another. This will lay the foundation for a revolution more comprehensive and all-encompassing than anything we have ever seen."</blockquote>

    <br>The convergence of the emerging technologies with society would undoubtedly be a fundamental force of change in the 21st century. Many of these changes would prove to be both anecdotes and poisons. I knew what I needed to do to point the needle in our favor, and I needed to learn software to do it. Only a day later I was enrolled in one of Portland's twelve week software bootcamp, and a week later the camp began. The new, long-term, more calibrated, and focused season of life had begun.
    <br><br>Throughout the 3-month course I also won first place in a Startup Weekend, a trip to SXSW and a few months coworking space downtown. After I finished, the next phase began: pushing code and networking.

    <hr><h5 class='chapter'>Now: Foot in the door</h5>
    It's been ~1 month since graduating, and I'm scouting Portland for an ambitious company join for a few years, starting with an entry-level engineering position. I'm prioritizing roles that would improve both my full stack development and algorithms & data structures, and other opportunities for growth.

    <hr><h5 class='chapter'>Into the future</h5>
    Though I iterate and improve my plans daily, I'm keeping they a secret, for now. I promise it stays true to myself and my mission, to constant self-improvement, never standing still, and to the pursuit of a better world for all. <span class='bold-italics'>To the future!</span>
