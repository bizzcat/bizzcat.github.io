  Welcome to my virtual cubbyhole. It's got a smorgasbord of code snippets,
  tales of adventure, transcripts of thought and more stashed inside.
  You'll learn a bit about what makes me tick, what I've done with my short
  time on this planet and my plans for the future. Thanks for stopping by.

  If you're interested why my tagline is <strong>nerd on a mission</strong>, here's my story, condensed and broken into chapters.

            0 to 17: Dreaming coupled with fear

      </div>
      <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
        <div class="panel-body">I was always a dreamer. As a child, I dreamt about exploring jurassic jungles, traveling through the cosmos, being a National Geographic photographer, opening hosptials for those in need... It never ended.

        <br><br>However, as I got older that dreaming was coupled with fear. I was stamped with ADD and believed medicine was the only way to function. I dropped out of high school halfway through, shielded myself from family trauma, and resigned myself to working retail forever. Only until one random December day at the age of 17 I had an awakening. I wasted 17 years of the one life I had, and I was going to squeeze the pulp out of the rest of it.</div>

      <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
        <div class="panel-body">
          It started with books, and lots of them. Philosophy, eastern spirituality, poetry, psychology, sociology, and so on. I was enthralled, and seeing friends on the weekend no longer mattered. Courage had dethroned my fear, and the dreams felt possible. I hurriedly got my GED, enrolled full time in community college and had counselors waive my heavy course loads. I transferred to university after a year.

          <br><br>There, I got involved in student leadership groups, local nonprofits and conversation circles with highly caffeinated idealists. I was promoted director of a nonprofit supporting Portland refugees, had studied in Turkey for 6 months, witnessed the Israeli/Palestinian conflict firsthand, fled to Beirut from Egypt because of violent protests, and observed new worlds.

          <br><br>I finished with a degree in Social Science. It was self designed, and focused on challenges we face as a global society. A booming population, rapid urbanization, a disturbed biosphere, inter-civilizational conflict, resource depletion, income inequality and more. One institution, the United Nations, put a rosy shade over my glasses and I wanted nothing more than to work for them.

          <br><br>It only took two weeks after graduating to move to Vietnam and work with the UN, and on an unrelated State Department project. It wasn't the panacea I thought it was, so after finishing both projects I founded Vietnam's first hacker and maker space, as well as a nonprofit supporting entrepreneurs and SME's with coaching, small investments, workshops, and more. Since my presence and energy was more critical during their formative phases, once they were sustainable I finished my year in Vietnam and flew back home. Then I got thinking again.

          <br><br>It took merely four years to achieve what I thought would take a life time... so I needed bigger dreams.

          I knew what I was capable of. I had an idea of where the world was going, and through that complexity I dialled in on what I wanted to do, and it involves emerging technologies. Why?

          <br><br>The opening sentence of the World Economic Forum's 2016 <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf">Future of Jobs Report</a> answered that pretty well:
          <br><blockquote>"Developments in genetics, artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing and biotechnology, to name just a few, are all building on and amplifying one another. This will lay the foundation for a revolution more comprehensive and all-encompassing than anything we have ever seen."</blockquote>

          <br>The convergence of the emerging technologies with society would undoubtedly be a fundamental force of change in the 21st century. Many of these changes would prove to be both anecdotes and poisons. I knew what I needed to do to point the needle in our favor, and I needed to learn software to do it. Only a day later I was enrolled in one of Portland's twelve week software bootcamp, and a week later the camp began. The new, long-term, more calibrated, and focused season of life had begun.
          <br><br>Throughout the 3-month course I also won first place in a Startup Weekend, a trip to SXSW and a few months coworking space downtown. After I finished, the next phase began: pushing code and networking.

I'm prioritizing roles that would improve both my full stack development and algorithms & data structures, and other opportunities for growth.
